Problem
=====================================================
	-Need to be able to run up and down slopes
	-Currently only have rectanglar "tile" collisions
	-Need to be able to jump
=====================================================
Details
=====================================================
	-Polyline slopes
	-const float JUMP_SPEED =0.7f;

=====================================================
Solution
=====================================================
	-New object layer in tiled called "slopes"
	-Draw slopes with the polyline tool
	-Create utiltiy class
	-Create slope class
	-Create lits of slopes in level class 
	-Parse them out of the .tmx file
	-Handle slope collision
	-Player jumping
=====================================================
Issues
=====================================================
	-NEED TO DEBUG SLOPES (12/3/16)
		-The slope functionality is not working in game as intended (12/3/16)
			-No Collision (12/3/16)
	-NEED TO DEBUG JUMP FUNCTION (12/3/16)
		-Unresponsive (12/3/16)
